# Actor Collaboration Network Analysis 🎬📊

Welcome to the Actor Collaboration Network Analysis project! In this assignment, we delve into the world of actor collaborations, examining the structure and characteristics of the actor network based on collaborations in movies between 1995 and 2004. The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of network analysis using the Igraph package.

## Table of Contents 📚

0. **Description & General Objective**: Overview of the project's objectives and datasets.
1. **Import Libraries**: Importing the necessary Python libraries.
2. **Import Datasets**: Loading the actors dataset for analysis.
3. **Graph Creation**: Creating the actor collaboration graph using Igraph and Networkx.
4. **Summary Statistics**: Calculating key network statistics.
5. **Degree Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of actor degrees.
6. **Network Diameter and Average Path Length**: Investigating the diameter and average path length.
7. **Node Importance: Centrality Measures**: Calculating centrality measures for actors.
8. **Community Detection**: Identifying communities within the actor network.
9. **Instructions**: Guidelines for completing the assignment and submitting results.

## General Objective 🎯

The objective of this assignment is to apply basic functions of the Igraph package for network analysis. We explore the actor collaboration network derived from the IMDB movie database and draw insights from the analysis of network properties.

## Datasets 📊

- **Actors dataset - undirected graph**: A reduced version of the IMDB movie database, focusing on actor-actor collaboration edges where actors co-starred in at least 2 movies together between 1995 and 2004.

## Inverse Weight 🔄

In this analysis, we consider the weight of edges in the context of actor collaborations. The concept of inverse weight is introduced to reflect the strength of relationships between actors in the network. Larger weights represent stronger relationships due to more collaborations, resulting in shorter distances in the graph.

## Community Detection 🕵️‍♂️

The community detection section utilizes the multilevel algorithm to identify underlying community structures within the actor network. This reveals groups of closely related actors and provides insights into network organization.

## Instructions 📝

The assignment requires completion of code chunks, analysis of results, and answering short questions. Please fill in the provided CSV with your answers and upload both this document in HTML and the CSV with your solutions.
